## Description

**MetaSpy** is a Python-based OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to extract EXIF metadata from image files. 

Modern digital cameras and smartphones embed hidden data inside images, including device models, timestamps, and often **precise GPS coordinates**. MetaSpy reads this data and, if GPS info is available, generates a direct **Google Maps link** to the location where the photo was taken.

### Key Features

  **GPS Extraction:** Converts raw GPS data into a clickable Google Maps link.
  **Device Info:** Identifies the camera make, model, and software used.
  **Timestamp Analysis:** Reveals the exact date and time the photo was captured.
  **Python Powered:** Lightweight and easy to use via CLI.
